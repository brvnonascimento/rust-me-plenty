# rust-me-plenty

This is my first HTTP Server with Rust, using the Actix Web Framework.

My goal is to build an experimental project using Rust on the backend with Actix Web, use only RAW SQL with PostgreSQL and a Rust front-end with WebAssembly. Any ideas for the project are well welcome! Otherwise it can serve as boilerplate for future projects.
